1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    public class Smartphone extends Technology{
      int number;
   public Smartphone(String name, int number){
     super(name);
     this.number=number;}
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.
To inherit all the fields and methods in the parent class.
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
public String getName(){
  return this.name;}
public String getNumber(){
  return this.number;}
public void speak(){
  System.out.println("My name is "+this.getName()+". My number is "+this.getName()+".");}
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
polymorphism
